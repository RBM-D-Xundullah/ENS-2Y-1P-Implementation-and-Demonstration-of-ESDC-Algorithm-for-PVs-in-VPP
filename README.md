# Implementation and Demonstration of Energy-Related Sensing Data Cleaning Algorithm for Photovoltaic Power Plants in Virtual Power Plant

> <u>Description</u>: 
This system involves implementing and demonstrating an energy-related sensing data cleaning algorithm for photovoltaic power plants in a virtual power plant. The system involves using Python code to connect to a remote database and retrieve data from multiple power plants, perform data preprocessing and analysis, and prepare the data for machine learning and deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The system's primary goal is to clean and process the data from multiple power plants to make it suitable for analysis and use in decision-making processes.


> <u>Python Code for Data Retrieval and Preprocessing</u>: 
The Python code involves connecting to a remote database, retrieving data from multiple power plants, and preprocessing the data by separating power plants using their C_pcode, dropping unnecessary columns, resetting index, converting date-time into timestamp, and defining data frames for each power plant. The data is then saved as gzip files in a local drive. The data is also prepared for machine learning and deep reinforcement learning algorithms by dropping unnecessary data, renaming columns, and setting the index with a timestamp. Finally, the data frames are combined into a single raw data frame, and the total power is calculated.
